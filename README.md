# Twitter Data Analysis and Visualization

## Overview

This project provides an in-depth analysis and visualization of graphs using Stanford's Twitter data. By running the `main.ipynb` file, you can explore various aspects of the data and generate insightful visualizations.

## Features

- **Data Loading:** Efficiently loads Stanford's Twitter dataset.
- **Data Cleaning:** Cleans and preprocesses the data for analysis.
- **Graph Analysis:** Performs various analyses on the data, including centrality measures, community detection, and more.
- **Visualization:** Generates interactive and static visualizations to help understand the structure and properties of the Twitter graph.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages (see below)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/aatifahmad123/twitter-data-analysis.git
    cd twitter-data-analysis
    ```
2. **Run Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

3. **Open and run `main.ipynb`:**
    - Navigate to the cloned repository folder in the Jupyter Notebook interface.
    - Open `main.ipynb`.
    - Run the cells sequentially to perform the analysis and visualization.

## Usage

The `main.ipynb` file contains step-by-step instructions and code cells for:

1. **Loading the Data:** 
    - Load and inspect the Stanford Twitter dataset.
    
2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
    - Handle missing values, duplicates, and other data quality issues.
    
3. **Graph Construction:**
    - Construct a graph from the Twitter data.
    
4. **Graph Analysis:**
    - Analyze the graph using various measures such as centrality, community detection, etc.
    
5. **Visualization:**
    - Generate visualizations to better understand the data.
